# About Me #
My name is Andri Mar and I'm a software developer most interested in embedded development, programming languages and games. I'm an active member, and part of the board, of [Hakkavélin](http://www.hakkavelin.is "Reykjavík Hackerspace") hackerspace in [Reykjavík](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjavík).

I got my B. Sc. degree in Computer Science from [Reykjavík University](http://ru.is) in 2007 and worked for [CCP Games hf.](http://ccpgames.com) for 4 and a half years before leaving this January. Currently I'm working on my own small projects whilst job hunting.

If you want to contact me I'm usually available via [email](andri.m.jonsson@gmail.com) and on `#hakkavelin` IRC channel on freenode where I go by the name `andrimar`.
